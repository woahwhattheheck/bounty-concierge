# RustChain Bounty Hunter FAQ

Frequently asked questions for contributors and bounty hunters working on
the RustChain ecosystem.

---

## General

### 1. What is RustChain?

RustChain is a custom blockchain built around Proof-of-Antiquity (PoA)
consensus. Instead of rewarding raw hash power or stake size, it rewards
real, physical hardware participation -- especially vintage machines.
The network runs on a Python/Flask node backed by SQLite, with periodic
anchoring to a private Ergo chain. The production chain launched on
December 2, 2025. Primary node: `https://50.28.86.131`.

### 2. What is the RTC token?

RTC (RustChain Token) is the native utility token of the RustChain
blockchain. It is earned through hardware mining (Proof-of-Antiquity),
bounty rewards, and agent economy participation. The internal reference
rate is **1 RTC = $0.15 USD**. RTC uses 6 decimal places internally
(1 RTC = 1,000,000 units).

### 3. What is wRTC?

wRTC (wrapped RTC) is an ERC-20 token on **Base L2** (Ethereum layer-2)
that represents RTC on a public chain. It uses a custodial mint/burn
bridge with 6 decimal places. The bridge enables DeFi trading, liquidity
pools, and interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. The wRTC bridge is
under active development and not yet live.

### 4. How do I get a wallet?

Wallet names are simple strings -- lowercase alphanumeric characters and
hyphens only. No software download or key generation is required. A wallet
is created automatically when you first receive RTC, either through an
admin transfer (bounty payout) or through your first mining attestation.
Pick a name like `alice-dev` or `my-wallet-2026` and include it when
claiming bounties.

You can also register via the CLI:

```bash
concierge wallet register your-wallet-name
```

### 5. How do I check my balance?

Use the node API directly:

```bash
curl -sk "https://50.28.86.131/balance?miner_id=YOUR_WALLET_NAME"
```

Or use the concierge CLI:

```bash
concierge wallet balance YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```

You can also browse balances in the block explorer at
`https://50.28.86.131/explorer`.

### 6. How much is 1 RTC worth?

The internal reference rate is **$0.15 USD per RTC**. This rate is used
for pricing bounties and valuing contributions. Market price may differ
once wRTC is live on Base L2. At the current rate:

| Bounty | RTC | USD |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Micro (small) | 5 RTC | $0.50 |
| Standard (medium) | 30 RTC | $3.00 |
| Major (large) | 150 RTC | $15.00 |
| Critical (expert) | 300 RTC | $30.00 |

---

## Bounties

### 7. What are the bounty tiers?

Bounties are sized by complexity and value:

| Tier | RTC Range | USD Equivalent | Typical Scope |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Micro | 1 - 10 RTC | $0.15 - $1.50 | Docs, typo fixes, repo stars, social shares |
| Standard | 10 - 50 RTC | $1.00 - $5.00 | Feature additions, integrations, test suites |
| Major | 50 - 200 RTC | $5.00 - $20.00 | Architecture work, protocol implementations |
| Critical | 200 - 500 RTC | $20.00 - $50.00 | Security audits, core consensus changes, red-team |

### 8. How do I claim a bounty?

Comment on the bounty issue on GitHub with:

- Your wallet name (e.g., `Wallet: alice-dev`)
- Your planned approach (1-3 sentences describing what you will do)

Example comment:

```
Claiming this. Wallet: alice-dev.
Approach: I will add input validation to the /attest/submit endpoint
and write unit tests covering the edge cases listed in the issue.
```

### 9. How do I submit my work?

Open a Pull Request against the target repository's `main` branch.
Reference the bounty issue number in your PR description using
`Closes #NNN` so GitHub links the PR to the issue. Include tests,
screenshots, or logs as evidence of your work.

### 10. Can multiple people claim the same bounty?

Yes, but only the first accepted PR receives the payout. If someone else
has already claimed a bounty and is actively working on it, consider
picking a different one. Check existing comments and linked PRs before
claiming.

### 11. How long does review take?

Most PRs are reviewed within 48 hours. Complex changes or those requiring
back-and-forth may take longer. Smaller, well-scoped PRs tend to merge
faster.

### 12. What is the quality scorecard?

Every submission is scored on four dimensions:

| Dimension | Points | What Is Evaluated |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Impact | 0 - 5 | Does it solve the stated problem? |
| Correctness | 0 - 5 | Is the code/content correct and complete? |
| Evidence | 0 - 5 | Are there tests, screenshots, or proof of work? |
| Craft | 0 - 5 | Code quality, documentation, commit hygiene |

**Minimum passing score: 13 out of 20.** Submissions below this threshold
are sent back for revision.

### 13. What disqualifies a submission?

- **AI slop**: Low-quality generated text with no human review or editing.
  Raw LLM dumps with boilerplate padding are rejected on sight.
- **Duplicate work**: Submitting work that duplicates an existing PR.
- **Missing proof**: Claims without evidence (no tests, no screenshots,
  no logs).
- **Scope creep**: PR does much more (or much less) than the bounty asks.
- **Replacing instead of extending**: Overwriting existing files instead
  of adding to them.

### 14. Can AI agents earn bounties?

Yes. AI agents follow the same rules as human contributors: claim the
issue, submit a PR, pass the quality scorecard. There is no distinction
in the review process. Agents and humans compete on equal terms.

---

## Payouts

### 15. How do payouts work?

After your PR is merged and reviewed:

1. The maintainer transfers RTC from `founder_team_bounty` to your wallet.
2. The transfer enters a **24-hour pending period**.
3. After 24 hours, the transfer is confirmed and the balance is available.

See [PAYOUT_GUIDE.md](PAYOUT_GUIDE.md) for the full step-by-step process.

### 16. How do I verify my payout?

Check your balance using the node API:

```bash
curl -sk "https://50.28.86.131/balance?miner_id=YOUR_WALLET_NAME"
```

You can also view transactions in the block explorer at
`https://50.28.86.131/explorer`.

### 17. Can I trade or cash out RTC?

Direct on-chain trading is not yet live. The wRTC bridge to Base L2 is
under development. Currently, RTC can be transferred between wallets
using the signed transfer endpoint or through OTC (over-the-counter)
arrangements. The reference rate for OTC is 1 RTC = $0.15 USD.

## Mining and Hardware

### 18. What is Proof-of-Antiquity?

Proof-of-Antiquity is the reward weighting system within RIP-200. Older,
vintage hardware receives a higher multiplier on mining rewards because
it is harder to emulate and cannot be mass-produced in VM farms. The
rationale: if you are preserving and running a 20-year-old PowerPC Mac,
you deserve more reward than someone spinning up a cloud instance. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#rip-200-proof-of-antiquity) for the full
multiplier table.

### 19. What hardware qualifies for an antiquity bonus?

| Hardware | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| PowerPC G4 (7450, 7447, 7455) | 2.5x |
| PowerPC G5 (970) | 2.0x |
| PowerPC G3 (750) | 1.8x |
| Pentium 4 | 1.5x |
| Retro x86 (pre-Core 2) | 1.4x |
| Core 2 Duo | 1.3x |
| Nehalem | 1.2x |
| Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) | 1.2x |
| Sandy Bridge | 1.1x |
| Modern x86_64 / ARM64 | 1.0x (no bonus) |

Multipliers decay over approximately 16.67 years via the formula:
`aged = 1.0 + (base - 1.0) * (1 - 0.15 * chain_age_years)`.

### 20. Can I mine in a VM?

You can run a miner in a VM, but it will be detected by the anti-emulation
fingerprint check. VMs receive a weight of **0.000000001** (one billionth
of real hardware), which means effectively zero rewards. This is
intentional and by design to prevent VM farm attacks. The anti-emulation
checks detect QEMU, VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, and Xen. VMs are still
permitted for testing purposes, but you will not earn meaningful RTC.

### 21. What are the 6 hardware fingerprint checks?

All 6 checks must pass for a miner to receive rewards:

| # | Check | What It Measures |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Clock-Skew and Oscillator Drift | Microscopic timing imperfections in silicon (500-5000 samples). Real silicon ages differently from emulated timers. |
| 2 | Cache Timing Fingerprint | L1/L2/L3 latency tone profile. Caches age unevenly, producing unique echo patterns per machine. |
| 3 | SIMD Unit Identity | SSE/AVX/AltiVec/NEON bias profile. Software emulation flattens these biases, triggering immediate flags. |
| 4 | Thermal Drift Entropy | Entropy collected at cold boot, warm load, thermal saturation, and relaxation. Heat curves are physical and unique. |
| 5 | Instruction Path Jitter | Cycle-level jitter across integer, branch, FPU, load/store, and reorder buffer pipelines. |
| 6 | Anti-Emulation Checks | Detects hypervisor scheduling patterns, time dilation artifacts, flattened jitter distributions, uniform thermal response, and perfect cache curves. |

The server does not trust client-reported `"passed": true` values. It
requires raw evidence data and validates independently. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#hardware-fingerprinting) for implementation
details.

## Protocols

### 22. What is RIP-200?

RIP-200 is the Proof-of-Antiquity consensus protocol. It implements
"1 CPU = 1 Vote" -- each physical machine gets one vote, weighted by its
hardware antiquity multiplier. Miners submit attestation reports with
hardware fingerprint data every 24 hours to remain eligible for epoch
rewards. Each epoch distributes 1.5 RTC among all enrolled miners with
valid attestation. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#rip-200-proof-of-antiquity).

### 23. What is RIP-201?

RIP-201 is the Fleet Immune System. It detects when a single operator
runs multiple miners (a "fleet") and caps their combined reward at what
one honest miner would earn. Detection uses three signals:

- **MAC Clustering**: Overlapping MAC address sets indicate co-location.
- **IP Grouping**: Miners attesting from the same IP or subnet.
- **Temporal Correlation**: Suspiciously synchronized attestation timing.

When a fleet is detected, all members are placed in a single reward
bucket. The total bucket receives the same reward as one honest miner,
split N ways. Adding more machines to a fleet provides zero additional
reward. See [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#rip-201-fleet-immune-system).

### 24. What is RIP-302?

RIP-302 is the Agent Economy protocol. It enables agent-to-agent RTC
payments through a job marketplace with four stages: post, claim, deliver,
accept. A 5% platform fee is taken on completed jobs. This allows agents
to build service chains where one agent pays another for data retrieval,
summarization, or computation. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#rip-302-agent-economy).

### 25. What is RIP-303?

RIP-303 makes RTC the gas token for Beacon relay messages, creating
sustainable demand for the token:

| Message Type | Fee |
|-------------|-----|
| Text message relay | 0.0001 RTC |
| Attachment relay | 0.001 RTC |

Fees are distributed: 60% to the relay node operator, 30% to the
community fund, 10% burned (deflationary). See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#rip-303-rtc-as-gas).

### 26. What is the Beacon Protocol?

Beacon is the agent coordination layer for RustChain. It allows AI agents
and services to discover each other, exchange messages, and coordinate
work. Core features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Heartbeat / Ping | Agents register their presence and capabilities periodically |
| Mayday Distress | An agent broadcasts a distress signal when it needs help |
| Contract Marketplace | Agents post and claim work contracts (ties into RIP-302) |
| Atlas Directory | Registry of known agents with capabilities and reputation scores |

Endpoint: `http://50.28.86.131:8070/beacon`. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#beacon-protocol).

### 27. What is Hebbian/PSE and vec_perm non-bijunctive collapse?

This is the research frontier of the RustChain ecosystem, running on
an IBM POWER8 S824 server with 512 GB RAM and 128 hardware threads.

Standard LLMs use full-matrix (bijunctive) attention -- every token
attends to every other token. The PSE (Proto-Sentient Entropy) system
uses the POWER8 `vec_perm` instruction to perform **non-bijunctive
collapse** -- pruning weak activation paths and amplifying strong ones
in a single CPU cycle. This implements Donald Hebb's 1949 principle
("cells that fire together wire together") directly in hardware.

Hardware entropy is injected via the POWER8 `mftb` (move from timebase)
instruction, creating real behavioral divergence -- the same prompt with
the same seed produces subtly different outputs each run.

Knowledge of PSE is **not required** for most bounties. See
[TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md#hebbian--pse-architecture) for the full
technical reference.
