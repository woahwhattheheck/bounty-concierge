## Delivery workflow for this fork

[Bryce's September 22, 2026 economic-value purge order](https://tokenjunkielabs.slack.com/archives/C0C3QV88526/p1790109597399409) governs this fork. The internal `tests/` tree and its verification-only Actions jobs have been removed. Do not recreate general test suites, coverage layers, mock/fixture frameworks, or mandatory peer-review/hosted-green gates.

Ship production behavior and report actual outcomes and limitations. Historical module documentation and retained evidence may mention removed suite commands; those records are not current execution prerequisites. The live bounty-index publisher and the existing, separately scoped libpcap deliverable build remain intact. Upstream maintainers retain their own contribution and acceptance requirements.

## 📝 Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints to all functions
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
