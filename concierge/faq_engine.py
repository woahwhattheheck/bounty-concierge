        "RTC (RustChain Token) is the native token of the RustChain network. "

        "protocol.  Internal reference rate: 1 RTC = $0.15 USD."

    "how do i set up a wallet": (
        "Install the RustChain wallet package (Standard, Founder, or Secure "
        "edition) from the .deb packages or run the PyInstaller binary.  "
        "On first launch the wallet generates a BIP39 24-word seed phrase and "
        "an Ed25519 keypair.  Your address starts with 'RTC...'."
    ),
    "how do payouts work": (
        "Bounty payouts are made in RTC after a PR is merged or a deliverable "
        "is accepted.  An admin triggers a signed transfer via the "
        "/wallet/transfer/signed endpoint.  You will see the RTC in your "
        "wallet balance within one epoch (~10 minutes)."
    ),
    "what is wrtc": (
        "wRTC (Wrapped RTC) is a planned representation of RTC on the Ergo "

    "what is proof of antiquity": (
        "Proof of Antiquity (PoA) is RustChain's unique consensus mechanism "
        "that rewards vintage and exotic hardware with multiplied mining "
        "rewards.  A PowerPC G4 earns 2.5x, a G5 earns 2.0x, Apple Silicon "
        "earns 1.2x, and modern x86_64 earns 1.0x.  Multipliers decay slowly "

    "can i mine in a vm": (

        "approximately 1 billionth of real hardware rewards.  This is by "
        "design to prevent VM farms.  Use real hardware for meaningful rewards."

    "what is beacon": (
